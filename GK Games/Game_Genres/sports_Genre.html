        <br>    Sports games speak for themselves, typically simulations or arcades of various sports. These games offer lots of fun, and, with the standard online feature 
        <br>    with a base of players around the world, this genre has never been bigger. They are also often closely tied to real world events and players, adding an 
        <br>    authenticity which other genres struggle to offer. The real world element means that with yearly updates sports titles provide publishers with a steady income 
        <br>    for relatively little input, and provide players with an engaging way to simulate the real world. Competition is the core of these games, which also provide 
        <br>    a different type of socialization than other genres and this is what makes them unique compared to other genres.
