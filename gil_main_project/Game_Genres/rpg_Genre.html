         An RPG is not an RPG without a story that keeps us invested and makes us want to continue playing. Some tell grand tales of saving the world from evil, 
    <br> while others can be more personal and tell of the journey of a group of friends. Either way, RPGS make us feel like we are a part of the story. 
    <br> All the twists and turns that can happen and how it effects the game keep us on the edge of our seats. We feel like we have an influence on the plot 
    <br> that unfolds, and therefore do our best to make sure we achieve the goals set before us. This is especially true in RPGs that have multiple endings, 
    <br> meaning the choices we make are even more crucial to the end game, and that excites us.
